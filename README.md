# V-slot-Gantry
An Open-source parametric Gantry for creating CNC machines from V-slot Aluminum profiles and bearings.

Any CNC machine is a collection of motion systems held together by rigid joints and actuated by positon controlled electronics. The accuracy and repeatability of the machine depends on the quality of the motion systems.

A motion system in simple terms is constraining decrees of freedom, to the one we want. There are many ways to do this, from rollers to sliding joints to linear bearings.
